In June 2020, the company received permission to conduct Phase I and Phase II human trials of a&#10;developmental COVID-19 vaccine codenamed BBV152, from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), Government of India.A total of 12 &#10;sites were selected by the Indian Council for Medical Research for Phase I and II randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical &#10;trials of vaccine candidate.&#10;In January 2021, the company published Phase I trial results in The Lancet. On March 8, 2021, Phase II results were published in The Lancet. &#10;The study showed that Phase II trials had a higher immune response and induced T-cell response due to the difference in dosing regime from &#10;Phase I. The doses in Phase II were given at 4 weeks interval as opposed to 2 weeks in Phase I. Neutralization response of the vaccine were &#10;found significantly higher in Phase II.&#10;&#10;2) Phase 3 Trials:&#10;In November 2020, Covaxin received the approval to conduct Phase III human trials after completion of Phase I and II. A randomised, double-&#10;blinded, placebo-controlled study among volunteers of age group 18 and above, it started on 25 November and involved around 26,000 &#10;volunteers from across 22 sites in India. Refusal rate for Phase III trials was much higher than that for Phase I and Phase II. As a result, only &#10;13,000 volunteers had been recruited by 22 December with the number increasing to 23,000 by 5 January.&#10;&#10;Multiple ethical breaches have been reported at one of their trial sites in Bhopal, potentially hampering the quality of overall data.&#10;&#10;In April 2021, Bharat Biotech reported via a press-release that efficacy is 78%, in its interim analysis of its phase 3 trial&#10;&#10;">

Another analysis &#10;showed that, for symptomatic COVID-19 infection after the second dose, the vaccine is 66% effective against B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant, and 60% &#10;against B.1.617.2 (delta) variant.&#10;The vaccine has a good safety profile, with side effects including injection-site pain, headache, and nausea, all generally resolving within a &#10;few days. More rarely, anaphylaxis may occur (the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has 268 reports out of &#10;some 21.2 million vaccinations as of 14 April 2021)&#10;&#10;&#10;">

On 31 &#10;AugustAstraZeneca announced that it had begun enrollment of adults for a US-funded, 30,000-subject late-stage study.&#10;Clinical trials for the vaccine candidate were halted worldwide on 8 September, as AstraZeneca investigated a possible adverse reaction which &#10;occurred in a trial participant in the UK. Trials were resumed on 13 September after AstraZeneca and Oxford, along with UK regulators,concluded &#10;it was safe to do so. AstraZeneca was later criticised for refusing to provide details about potentially serious neurological side effects in two trial &#10;participants who had received the experimental vaccine in the UK. While the trials resumed in the UK, Brazil, South Africa, Japan and India, the&#10;US did not resume clinical trials of the vaccine until 23 October. This was due to a separate investigation by the Food and Drug Administration &#10;surrounding a patient illness that triggered a clinical hold, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary &#10;Alex Azar.&#10;&#10;2) Phase 3 Trials:&#10;On 22 March 2021, AstraZeneca released interim results from the phase III trial conducted in the US that showed efficacy of 79% at preventing &#10;symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% efficacy at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation.The next day, the National Institute of Allergy and &#10;Infectious Diseases (NIAID) published a statement countering that those results may have relied on &quot;outdated information&quot; that may have &#10;provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.AstraZeneca later revised its efficacy claim to be 76% after further review of the data.">
