This application was created for a project in my college. This desktop application basically extracts information from the web and displays that information in front of all the users. Database is also used in this application to store the user information in order for them to dynamically login and check their information inside this app.

This application has the following features:

1) Getting vaccine centre information.
2) Displaying Covid-19 statistics of India.
3) Displaying state wise Covid-19 statistics for India.
4) Displaying country wise Covid-19 statistics for the World.
5) Self Assessment for users to check the amount of risk. (Does not use Machine Learning. It contains predefined variables with fixed constant values and each checkbox has some value assigned to it which keeps on getting added).
6) Displaying Covid related information.

NOTE: This application still has a lot of scope and I am still working on this project.
