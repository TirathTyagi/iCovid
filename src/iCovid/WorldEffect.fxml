The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people &#10;are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could &#10;increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.&#10;&#10;Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods.&#10;Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and &#10;have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and &#10;their families.&#10;&#10;Millions of agricultural workers – waged and self-employed – while feeding the world, regularly face high levels of working poverty, &#10;malnutrition and poor health, and suffer from a lack of safety and labour protection as well as other types of abuse. With low and irregular &#10;incomes and a lack of social support, many of them are spurred to continue working, often in unsafe conditions, thus exposing themselves &#10;and their families to additional risks. Further, when experiencing income losses, they may resort to negative coping strategies, such as &#10;distress sale of assets, predatory loans or child labour.&#10;&#10;In the COVID-19 crisis food security, public health, and employment and labour issues, in particular workers’ health and safety, converge. &#10;Adhering to workplace safety and health practices and ensuring access to decent work and the protection of labour rights in all industries &#10;will be crucial in addressing the human dimension of the crisis. Immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods should include&#10; extending social protection towards universal health coverage and income support for those most affected.&#10;&#10;Countries dealing with existing humanitarian crises or emergencies are particularly exposed to the effects of COVID-19. Responding swiftly &#10;to the pandemic, while ensuring that humanitarian and recovery assistance reaches those most in need, is critical.">
